# Crochet Bath Set Collection

This is another collection of various crochet projects. I made made these items multiple times for various people and I find great joy in making them. There's something so lovely in making handcrafted presents focused on self-care. Even if no one in my family has been particularly grateful for these presents, I will keep making them and giving them away!

### Materials
- Hook: 4.5mm
- Scissors
- Stitch marker

#### Yarn
- A: Allegro, Tango, color Crudo.
- B: Allegro, Tango, color Cafe.

### Notes:
An unexpected entry in this collection. I made a pair exchanging the colors for the body and border. The other currently serves as a dishcloth and this one ended up as a washcloth. The thick and absorbent cotton yarn makes it useful as a replacement for a full towel, if just slightly too small for me. I would recommend increasing the initial chain count. Very useful for travel.
